# How to Push Your React Native Apps to GitHub

This guide shows you how to upload your AI-generated React Native apps to GitHub repositories.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Automated)

Use our automated script to push your converted Expo apps to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/yusufziyatemiz/source/app-creator
python scripts/push_to_github.py
```

This script will:
- ✅ Initialize git repositories for each app
- ✅ Create professional README files
- ✅ Set up proper .gitignore files
- ✅ Commit all files with meaningful messages
- ✅ Create GitHub repositories (with GitHub CLI)
- ✅ Push code to GitHub

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required:
- **Git** - Install from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- **GitHub account** - Sign up at https://github.com

### Optional (for automation):
- **GitHub CLI** - Install with `brew install gh` (macOS)

## 🛠️ Setup Methods

### Option 1: Automated Upload (Recommended)

1. **Convert your apps to Expo format first:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/convert_to_expo.py
   ```

2. **Run the GitHub uploader:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/push_to_github.py
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts:**
   - Choose to upload all apps or select specific ones
   - Decide between creating new repos or pushing to existing ones
   - Authenticate with GitHub if prompted

### Option 2: Manual Upload

If you prefer manual control:

1. **Navigate to your converted app:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/expo_projects/TodoListApp
   ```

2. **Initialize git repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: TodoListApp generated by AI Builder Agent"
   ```

3. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Create a new repository named "todo-list-app"
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/todo-list-app.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

1. **Navigate to your app:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/expo_projects/TodoListApp
   ```

2. **Create and push in one command:**
   ```bash
   gh repo create todo-list-app --public --source=. --push
   ```

## 📁 What Gets Uploaded

Each repository will contain:

```
your-app-name/
├── README.md                   # Professional documentation
├── .gitignore                 # Proper ignore patterns
├── app.json                   # Expo configuration
├── package.json               # Dependencies and scripts
├── App.js                     # Main app component
├── src/
│   ├── screens/              # Generated screens
│   └── components/           # Reusable components
└── assets/                   # Placeholder for images
```

## 🎯 Repository Features

The automated script creates repositories with:

- ✅ **Professional README** with setup instructions
- ✅ **Complete documentation** for running the app
- ✅ **Proper .gitignore** for React Native/Expo projects
- ✅ **Package.json** with all necessary scripts
- ✅ **Installation instructions** for multiple platforms
- ✅ **Deployment guides** for app stores

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Git not installed
```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Or download from https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

### GitHub CLI not installed
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Or use manual method instead
```

### Authentication issues
```bash
# Configure git credentials
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Login to GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

### Repository already exists
If you get an error about repository already existing:
1. Go to GitHub and delete the existing repository
2. Or push to the existing repository instead
3. Or rename your local repository

## 📚 Next Steps After Upload

Once your apps are on GitHub:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (for web versions)
2. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
3. **Add collaborators** to work on the project
4. **Create issues** for feature requests
5. **Set up branch protection** rules

## 🌐 Sharing Your Apps

After uploading to GitHub, you can:

- **Share the repository URL** with others
- **Deploy to Netlify/Vercel** for web versions
- **Set up Expo EAS** for mobile builds
- **Submit to app stores** using the built APK/IPA files

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use meaningful commit messages** when making changes
2. **Create branches** for new features: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. **Write good README files** to help others understand your app
4. **Add screenshots** to showcase your app's UI
5. **Tag releases** when you publish new versions

## 🎉 Example Results

After running the upload script, you'll have repositories like:

- `https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app`
- `https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app`
- `https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app`

Each with professional documentation and ready for collaboration!
